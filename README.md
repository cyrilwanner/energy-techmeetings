# Energy Techmeetings

Some of my presentations for internal Tech Meetings @ [Energy](https://energy.ch) are stored in this repository. Every presentations took between 30m and 1h30m, including some questions at the end.

They are sometimes not self explanatory without oral explanation, so if you have any question, just hit me on slack or using another communication method (email, twitter, ..).
