# Energy Techmeetings

Some of my presentations for internal Tech Meetings @ [Energy](https://energy.ch) are stored in this repository. Every presentations took between 30m and 1h30m, including some questions at the end.

They are sometimes not self explanatory without oral explanation, so if you have any question, just hit me on slack or any another communication method (email, twitter, ..).

## Topics

- [React](2018-03-16-react.md) [2018-03-16]:
  After completing an [online react course](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/), we have discussed the topics together and cleared some open questions.
  It contains summaries of the most important topics and also some questions/tasks to strengthen the learned things.

- [Next.js](2018-04-13-nextjs.md) [2018-04-13]:
  As we are building our new web applications with [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js), some basic and important features of Next.js are covered here.
  It also contains some questions and tasks.

- [MutationObserver, IntersectionObserver and Page Visibility API](2018-05-18-js-apis.md) [2018-05-18]:
  In this topic, the MutationObserver, IntersectionObserver and Page Visibility API are covered with examples and availability information.
  At the end, a real use-case on [energy.ch](https://energy.ch) is described which uses all these APIs together.

- [CSS Specificity / `!important`](2018-05-31-css-specificity.md) [2018-05-31]:
  `!important` often gets used out of lazyness or when the site/css structure doesn't get understood.
  So we cover how css calculates the specificity values and what possible ways are to avoid `!important` in our code.

- [Ephemeral Ports](2018-05-31-ephemeral-ports.md) [2018-05-31]:
  When configuring firewalls, we have to understand how the traffic flow works and what firewalls are capable of.
  With a recent problem as an example, we take a look at what we have to keep in mind and which firewalls AWS provides.

- [Different React and TypeScript Topics](2018-08-09-react-typescript.md) [2018-08-09]:
