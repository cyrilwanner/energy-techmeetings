## Features

<!--
    Next.js is a framework on react (library).

    Many performance optimizations which would require much work and maintenance to set it up by our own.
    Also, it does all the webpack & babel configuration out of the box but it is extendable with plugins.
-->

* Automatic transpilation and bundling (with webpack and babel)
* Automatic code splitting
* Hot code reloading
* Server rendering and indexing of ./pages (Automatic Routing)
* Static file serving. ./static/ is mapped to /static/
* Statically export websites
* Multiple zones

<!--
    Do you know what these features mean and what they actually do?
-->

## Routing

By default, next.js creates static routes for all files inside the `pages` folder.

```
pages/
  index.tsx
  about.tsx
  user/
    profile.tsx

->

/
/about
/user/profile
```

But this obviously doesn't allow parameters inside routes and our desired folder structure would not be possible.
So we use the [`next-routes`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-routes) plugin to have these features available.

```javascript
import Link from 'next/link';

const Home = () => (
    <Link href="/about">
        <a>About</a>
    </Link>
);

export default Home;
```

<!--
    `href` can either be the full url or the route name (later is preferred)
-->

## Custom Document / App / Errors

There can be some special files in the pages folder:
```
pages/
  _app.tsx
  _error.tsx
  _document.tsx
```

`_document` allows you to create the full html document (the stuff outside of the react context) with react.

`_error` allows you to overwrite the page shown when an error occurrs (404, 500, ...).

`_app` allows you to create a wrapper component in which all pages are rendered. Useful for a consistent layout of all pages or global components like a navigation or loading bar.
Global exceptions can also be catched and handled here.

All these special components are optional. The default next.js components will be used if they don't exist.

## Prefetching

Because of the automatic code splitting, every page lives in its own javascript file which ensures only the code needed for the current page actually gets loaded.

But when a new page gets requested, the file for the page first needs to get loaded before it can be rendered.
Prefetching makes it possible to preload a page in advance.

```javascript
import Link from 'next/link';

const Home = () => (
    <Link prefetch href="/about">
        <a>About</a>
    </Link>
);

export default Home;
```

As soon as the home page is loaded and rendered, all pages which have a prefetch link will get prefetched in the background (only in production).

## Initial props

Every **page** component can define the static `getInitialProps` function which gets called before the component gets mounted.
It can return a promise for which the component waits before it mounts.

<!--
    What could we do with this function?

    - loading data
    - checking authentication
-->

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```javascript
const ArticlesPage = ({ articles }) => (
    <div>
        {
            articles.map(article => <div key={article.entry_id}>{article.title}</div>)
        }
    </div>
);

ArticlesPage.getInitialProps = async () => {
    const res = await fetch('https://energy.ch/feeds/echapp');
    const json = await res.json();

    return {
        articles: json,
    };
};

export default ArticlesPage;
```

</details>

## Assets

All used assets (css, images, ...) get copied into the `/static/` during build, the only thing you have to do is import them normally in your code.

```javascript
import React from 'react';

export default () => (
  <div>
    <img src={require('./images/my-image.jpg')} />
    <img src={require('./images/my-small-image.png')} />
    <img src={require('./images/my-icon.svg')} />
  </div>
);
```

In production, images also get optimized using [`next-optimized-images`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-optimized-images) (compresses jpg, png & gif and removes comments/metadata/etc in svgs).
It is also possible to convert jpg and png images to webp during build.
Read its readme for more information.

## dev / prod build

<details>
  <summary>Differences</summary>

  * Pages only get built when request in development (not in advance like for production)
  * Many optimizations get only applied in production (tree shaking, sharing of common packages, css class names)
  * Pages only get prefetched in production

</details>

## Config & Plugins

`next.config.js` is the central place for configurations and plugins of next.js.
You can overwrite the default [configuration](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#custom-configuration) of next, manipulate the webpack configuration or enable a plugin.

```javascript
// next.config.js

module.exports = {
  distDir: 'build',
  webpack: (config, { buildId, dev, isServer, defaultLoaders }) => {
    // Perform customizations to webpack config

    // Important: return the modified config
    return config
  },
};
```

## Server Side Rendering / Client Side Rendering

<!--
    How does it work? What is available on the server and what on the client?
-->

<details>
  <summary>Differences</summary>

  Things available on the server:
  * Request & response object of express
  * Server environment variables

  Things available on the client:
  * DOM (window, document, ...)

  **Important**: All users are accessing the same node server, so make sure you only use **pure functions** and don't change a variable outside the current context!
  Otherwise, if two users are accessing the same page at the same time, they may overwrite each others variables which can lead to unexpected and hard debuggable errors.
